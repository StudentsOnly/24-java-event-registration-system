## Exercise: Event Registration System using HashSet in Java

#### Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to create a simple event registration system using a HashSet in Java. You will model the process of registering participants for events and displaying the registered participants.

#### Description:

You are tasked with developing a program that allows users to register participants for events and then displays the unique list of registered participants using a HashSet. Each participant is identified by their name.

#### Guidelines:

1.	Create a class named Participant with the following attribute:
    -  String name: to store the name of the participant.
2.	Create a class named EventRegistration that includes the following methods:
    -  registerParticipant that registers a participant for the event by adding their name to the HashSet.
    -  displayParticipants that displays the unique list of registered participants.
3.	Create instances of the EventRegistration class in the main method.
4.	Prompt the user to input participant names.
5.	Register the input participants for the event.
6.	Display the unique list of registered participants.
